**PSD** to **HTML**

Found a beautiful design and wanted to recreate it in exact and event better way then on **PSD**

It's pure fun not used in any commercial or profit way. It's practice while making a beautiful design.

What I done:

1. **HTML** / Sematic **HTML5**
2. **CSS** / reset.css / **SASS**
3. **JavaScript** / **jQuery** / AJAX / JSON / Slider
4. **GULP**
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/> a) Minify **JavaScript** and **CSS**
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/> b) Autoprefixer
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/> c) Cache
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/> d) **SASS** watch
5. **PHOTOSHOP**

Video has custom controls made with JavaScript. Double click fullscreen. Click pause/play.

Slider is draggable with mouse or touch screen and is dynamically made.

Desktop version is up and running. Next compatibility with other resolutions.
